# Multi-purpose-software-for-the-visually-impaired.
Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in navigating the world around them. Although traditional assistive technologies like canes and guided dogs can be helpful, they still rely on the user's ability to detect and react to obstacles in their environment. Moreover, these technologies do not provide real-time information about the location and distance of objects, making it difficult for users to plan their movements or make decisions quickly.


Our solution has three parts:
Obstacle detection with distance estimation and audio feedback,
Currency classification with audio feedback,
Automatic text to speech conversion using OCR technology,
For better results, we recommend to use a paid OCR such as AWS OCR or google OCR
